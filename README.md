PyLinq: A web implementation of Linq in Python
===============================================

This is a web implementation of the card game Linq in Python, using Websockets
and Knockout for client-side data binding.

It's merely an exercise for the author, and it's still largely incomplete; you
can join and start the game but not play it. It will be possible in due time :)

### Requirements:
 - Python 3.2+
 - Tornado 3.2+
